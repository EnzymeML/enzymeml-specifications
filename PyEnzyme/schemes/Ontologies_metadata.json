EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language, which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles.",
