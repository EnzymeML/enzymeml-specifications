## Why EnzymeML?

- **Data Exchange**:  
EnzymeML facilitates the sharing of enzyme kinetics data across scientists, tools, and databases, enabling collaborative research and integration of diverse datasets.
- **Efficiency**:  
By standardizing and automating data processing, it minimizes manual steps, reducing errors and saving time.
- **Compatibility**:  
EnzymeML adheres to FAIR principles and integrates with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), ensuring broad usability and extensibility.
- **No data - no AI-party**:  
EnzymeML is a data exchange format for biocatalysis catalyzed reaction data.

## How to Use EnzymeML?

Besides the generic [EnzymeML API](https://pyenzyme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) to read and write EnzymeML documents programmatically, there are tools enabling the processing of data from different analytical instruments:

- __Photometric Data__:  

- __Chromatographic Data__:  

- __NMR Data__:  


Chromatopy A versatile library used for processing chromatographic data.

MTPHandler A library for handling data from microtiter plate (MTP) readers. It supports various file formats and provides tools for data processing.

NMRPy A library that facilitates the analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data. It helps in spectral processing, visualization, and interpretation of (time-course) NMR experiments.
