## Content of the Online Offering
The author assumes no liability for the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, or quality of the information provided. Any liability claims against the author relating to material or non-material damages caused by the use or non-use of the presented information, or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information, are generally excluded unless there is demonstrable intentional or grossly negligent fault on the part of the author. All offers are non-binding and without obligation. The author expressly reserves the right to change, supplement, delete, or temporarily or permanently discontinue parts of the pages or the entire offering without prior notice.

## References and Links
For direct or indirect references to external websites ("links") that lie outside the author's area of responsibility, liability would only arise if the author had knowledge of the content and it was technically possible and reasonable to prevent the use of illegal content. The author hereby expressly declares that, at the time the links were set, no illegal content was recognizable on the linked pages. The author has no influence on the current and future design, content, or authorship of the linked pages. Therefore, the author expressly distances themselves from all content on linked pages that was changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all links and references within the author's own website as well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums, and mailing lists set up by the author. The provider of the referenced page, not the one who merely refers to it via links, is solely liable for illegal, incorrect, or incomplete content and especially for damages arising from the use or non-use of such presented information.

All brand names and trademarks mentioned on this website, including those protected by third parties, are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The mere mention of trademarks does not imply that they are not protected by third-party rights. The copyright for published objects created by the author remains solely with the author. The reproduction or use of such graphics, audio files, video sequences, and texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the express consent of the author.
