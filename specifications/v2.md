# EnzymeML V2

EnzymeML is a data exchange format that supports the comprehensive documentation of enzymatic data by describing reaction conditions, time courses of substrate and product concentrations, the kinetic model, and the estimated kinetic constants. EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language, which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles.

The format enables researchers to capture detailed experimental metadata, including environmental conditions like temperature, pH, and buffer composition that can significantly impact enzyme behavior. This comprehensive approach ensures that experiments can be accurately reproduced by other researchers, addressing a critical need in the enzyme research community.

One of EnzymeML's key strengths is its ability to facilitate data exchange between different software tools and platforms. Researchers can seamlessly transfer their experimental data from laboratory equipment to analysis software, and then to modeling tools for further investigation. This interoperability significantly reduces the time spent on data reformatting and minimizes the risk of transcription errors.

The format also supports the growing movement toward open science and reproducible research. By providing a standardized way to share enzymatic data, EnzymeML makes it easier for researchers to publish their complete experimental datasets alongside their findings. This transparency enables better peer review and validation of research results, ultimately advancing our understanding of enzyme function and behavior.
