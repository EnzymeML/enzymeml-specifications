# EnzymeML V2

EnzymeML is a data exchange format that supports the comprehensive documentation of enzymatic data by describing reaction conditions, time courses of substrate and product concentrations, the kinetic model, and the estimated kinetic constants. EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language, which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles.

The format enables researchers to capture detailed experimental metadata, including environmental conditions like temperature, pH, and buffer composition that can significantly impact enzyme behavior. This comprehensive approach ensures that experiments can be accurately reproduced by other researchers, addressing a critical need in the enzyme research community.

One of EnzymeML's key strengths is its ability to facilitate data exchange between different software tools and platforms. Researchers can seamlessly transfer their experimental data from laboratory equipment to analysis software, and then to modeling tools for further investigation.

## Enumerations

### EquationType

These values are used to determine the type of equation. ODE equations describe the rate of change of species over time, assignment equations define algebraic relationships between variables, initial assignments set starting values, and rate laws define reaction kinetics.

```python
ODE = "ode"
ASSIGNMENT = "assignment"
INITIAL_ASSIGNMENT = "initialAssignment"
RATE_LAW = "rateLaw"
```

### DataTypes

These values are used to determine the type of time course data. Each value corresponds to a standardized ontology term that precisely defines the measured physical quantity. For example, absorbance measurements use the Allotrope Foundation Quality ontology term, while concentration uses the Phenotype And Trait Ontology (PATO) term.

```python
ABSORBANCE = "absorbance"
CONCENTRATION = "concentration"
CONVERSION = "conversion"
PEAK_AREA = "peakArea"
TRANSMITTANCE = "transmittance"
FLUORESCENCE = "fluorescence"
```
